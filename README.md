# Spec2Cloud

**Ship Azure solutions faster with spec-driven toolkits**

![Spec2Cloud](docs/images/spec2cloud-banner.png)

Spec2Cloud is a collection of Azure-focused toolkits that help teams move from specification to production with fewer handoffs and less rework. Whether you want a fully orchestrated loop, GitHub Spec Kit components, or a lightweight Copilot plugin, Spec2Cloud gives you a practical path to consistent Azure delivery.

## 🧰 Toolkit Options

Choose the toolkit that matches your workflow:

1. [Loop Toolkit](https://emeaappgbb.github.io/spec2cloud/) - a fully orchestrated workflow powered by the Ralph Loop, with deterministic progress, persisted state, human approval gates, and increment-based delivery from spec to Azure deployment.
2. [Spec Kit 🌱](./spec-kit/) - a GitHub Spec Kit integration for Azure that combines a preset (core command and template overrides), an extension (verify and deploy commands), and a workflow for a gated lifecycle from constitution through deployment.
3. [Lean Toolkit](./plugins/lean-spec2cloud/) - a lightweight, opinionated Copilot plugin that streamlines the core specify → plan → implement → verify → deploy loop for Azure, with focused skills and minimal context overhead to optimize token consumption.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Lean Toolkit)

Use the Lean Toolkit when you want a fast, low-overhead workflow in Copilot.

1. **Install the Spec2Cloud plugin through the marketplace:**

   ```bash
   # Add the marketplace
   copilot plugin marketplace add Azure-Samples/Spec2Cloud
   ```

   ```bash
   # Install the plugin from the markeplace
   copilot plugin install lean@Spec2Cloud
   ```

   Prefer a pinned, reproducible setup? You can also install the Lean Toolkit through [APM (Agent Package Manager)](https://microsoft.github.io/apm/) by declaring it as a dependency in your project's `apm.yml`. See the [Alternative: Use with APM](./plugins/lean-spec2cloud/README.md#alternative-use-with-apm) section in the Lean plugin README for the full manifest example and commands.

2. **Install prerequisites for verify and deploy:**
   - Azure CLI (`az`)
   - Azure Developer CLI (`azd`)
   - Bicep CLI (`bicep`)

   **Authenticate with Azure:**

   ```bash
   azd auth login
   ```

3. **Run the full loop in one prompt:**

   ```bash
   copilot -p "/fleet lean:spec2cloud Build a todo web app with a C# backend deployed on App Service, using Cosmos DB for NoSQL as the data persistence layer." --no-ask-user --yolo
   ```

5. **Or run each stage step by step:**

   Run the stages in order. Each command accepts optional extra context after the slash command, and skills auto-chain — for example, running `/lean:implement` without a plan will trigger `/lean:plan` first.

   Capture or refine the requirements:

   ```text
   /lean:specify Build a todo web app with a C# backend deployed on App Service, using Cosmos DB for NoSQL as the data persistence layer.
   ```

   Produce the design and Azure deployment plan (optional — auto-runs if missing):

   ```text
   /lean:plan
   ```

   Generate the application code and IaC (optional extra guidance can steer implementation choices):

   ```text
   /lean:implement
   ```

   Exercise the implementation locally against provisioned Azure dependencies (optional extra instructions can specify a testing approach):

   ```text
   /lean:verify
   ```

   Deploy to Azure (optional extra instructions can include post-deployment actions):

   ```text
   /lean:deploy
   ```

### 🔧 VS Code Extension

Use the Spec2Cloud Toolkit extension to monitor spec-driven workflow progress and scaffold projects from templates directly in VS Code. It complements Copilot CLI workflows with a guided visual experience.

The extension includes views for workflow progress, installed custom agents and skills, and Azure context such as AZD environments, resource groups, Azure Monitor, Container Registry, Foundry projects, Container Apps, and App Service.
